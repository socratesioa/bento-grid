## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Very interesting design. Got the chance to brush up on CSS grid and flexbox.

### Continued development

Identifying the best plan of attack for each design really helps with the workflow. In this one for instance, I found that using a mobile first approach was the appropriate plan. As I do more and more projects I can identify such things more easily.
